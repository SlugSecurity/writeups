# Slug Security Writeups
Welcome to the home of [Slug Security](https://slugsec.ucsc.edu)'s writeups. Our repository, which is synced via Github submodules, is automatically updated and organized in the [writeups section](https://slugsec.ucsc.edu/writeups/) of our website.

## What Are Writeups?
Writeups are basically our way of sharing knowledge. They're reports or guides where we talk about security concepts, techniques, or solutions to security competitions/challenges. Think of them as in-depth pieces on what we've learned, what we've seen, or what we think is cool in security.

## Purpose
The idea behind these writeups is to share and spread information. We want to help others understand complex security topics, learn from incidents we've analyzed, or just get to get a head start or a glimpse into the world of security. It's our way of contributing to the community and fostering a culture of knowledge sharing.

## Navigation
You can navigate our writeups by visiting the respective year folders, where each competition or event is then further organized into its own directory. Within these, you'll find the challenges categorized and easy to browse. For example, if you wanted to view the writeups for `Amazing Test CTF 2023`, you would go to `/2023/Amazing Test CTF/`. From there, you can view the writeups for each challenge category, such as `web`, `pwn`, `crypto`, etc.

## Technical Details
Our main site uses Jekyll and Liquid to statically generate our website. We use a custom plugin to automatically generate structures for writeups and posts using Ruby scripts and Github submodules. We also use several markdown enhancement libraries such as [Mathjax](https://www.mathjax.org/), [Mermaid.JS](https://mermaid.js.org/), [Chart.JS](https://www.chartjs.org/), and a few more miscellaneous libraries to make our writeups more interactive and engaging. Viewing our writeups outside of our website may not be as pretty or as easy to read, but it should still be functional.
